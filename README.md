>Objective:
Automate the resizing and format conversion of images in bulk.

>Tools Used:

(a)Python – scripting language

(b)Pillow (PIL) – image processing library

(c)os – to handle folder and file operations

>Functionality:

Reads all images from a specified folder

Resizes them to a given dimension (e.g., 800×800 pixels)

Optionally converts images to a chosen format (JPEG, PNG, etc.)

Saves the processed images in an output folder

>Outcome:
A simple automation script that eliminates manual resizing tasks, making it faster and easier to prepare images for web use, presentations, or storage.
